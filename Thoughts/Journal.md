Tis a good weekend.  Had a nice slow weekend. Got the opportunity to code on some of the personal projects and personal code.

Gist in short: Started coding away the wireframe directory.  Used HTML5 boilerplate as a basis.  Used the initializr project, stripped out some cruft and laid that as the foundations.  Will jQuery be used, or some zepto.js microjs project.  Don't know.  But, doesn't hurt for now, and its not too much cruft.

Peppered the project with a little content, lorem ipsums, and placekittens all around.

Decently productive.

P.s. Lol, sometimes, I'm thinking here or there. "Man, that would be an awesome place for a partial" (ruby wise or php wise). But then I got to slow myself down, and say. Work on the pixels and fine tune the pages first.  Then modularize them.  Thats what the staticSiteGenerator will be for.

First Entry. Not no hello world, once again, that dastardly double negative.  Bonjour Telemundo, an amalgamation of two languages, and most likely used improperly.  Good morning along with a word connotative of world.  An Iberian peninsula language meshed with the language spoken in what was once the land of of ancient Gaul.

Bonjour Telemundo once again I say to a grand project.

Enjoy,
