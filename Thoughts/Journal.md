First Entry. Not no hello world, once again, that dastardly double negative.  Bonjour Telemundo, an amalgamation of two languages, and most likely used improperly.  Good morning along with a word connotative of world.  An Iberian peninsula language meshed with the language spoken in what was once the land of of ancient Gaul.

Bonjour Telemundo once again I say to a grand project.
