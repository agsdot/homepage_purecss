Readme:

Whereby, sometimes one just needs to revamp their homepage. Yes, its that time again.

Whereby, it is good to mock out and template ones website with straight html, css, javascript.  Mocked out pages shall be created in a directory.

Whereby, one needs to practice more responsive design and css. Hence be it so that the practice of a minimalistic css framework be used: [purecss](https://github.com/yui/pure/).

Whereby, for kicks, after the wireframed mockout is created, and includes the responsive design, may the design be transferred over to a static site builder.  This shall be made in a seperate directory.

Whereby, AWS and cloud storage and hosting are the future, and dreamhost and all its clones are the dinosaurs of the past, their shall be a concerted goal of transporting (decisions will be made later, rsync? git? decisions decisions for later....) the static files from both the mockup directory and the static site build/ resultant folder into an AWS or S3 storage bucket. 

Whereby, an AWS website or S3 storage bucket needs a domain aliased to it, and no one virtually memorizes IP addresses, a website domain from a popular registrar shall be aliased to the AWS site.

Be it henceforth said, these are the discrete goals of this homepage_purecss project. Furthermore, with goals being lined out*, may the project proceed in discrete concrete and measured steps.

P.s. While this Readme illustrates the broad picture, the small technical decisions as to what technology shall be decided shall be included in future Readme's contained within the subdirectories of the main project.
