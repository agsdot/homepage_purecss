README for Deployment and Devops

Ah, now we get to some fun stuff.

Technical decisions: deferred.  Decisions to be made?  What cloudhost to use, AWS, Openstack, DigitalOcean. Barebones cloud instances.  Not no PAAS heroku services (yes, a double negative was used). This is a learning opportunity and a chance to have a good time exploring. 

Things to learn: how to setup a Linux instance properly/security wise, and also install a webserver (another technical decision: apache, nginx, cherokee, etc), get familiar with the OS(Centos, Debian?) and the package manager(apt-get, yum?) and installing the language of choice (ruby, python, node).

Fun stuffs: mess around with Vagrant and Chef.  Use some bash scripts.  See where Docker ties into this all.  Development locally, and deployment (not) locally, aka remotely.  Also in terms of deployment, choices to be made.  Once the static files are generated, how to deploy the build files: git, rsync, sftp?  Another combo?  Once again, another package to install and deploy on the remote webserver.

More fun stuffs, arg the learning experiences: learning about dns and name servers and aliasing domains to IP's and servers.  Getting to know the 1and1, namecheaps, and godaddy's of the world.  Ah, bask in the light and warmth of registrar land.
