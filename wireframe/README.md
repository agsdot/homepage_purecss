README for the wireframing of the Homepage Purecss

Content Decisions
  The site should have sections for About, Contact, Work Experience, Services, and Personal Details/Bio.
  Those may be in the navbar, or a different wording of them.
  Their should be a page per navbar item. 
  
Technical Decisions
  The site must be responsive.
  The site will use a css framework.  Rather than using Zurb or Twitter Bootstrap, PureCss has been chosen on the recommendation of a friend.  Its more of a minimal framework, that forces one to truly fine tune and wield CSS powers. 

Stylistic Decisions
  The site of course must be responsive and mobile friendly.  
  For now, the preliminary run, the spartan, austere (current popular trend of minimalism) shall be bandwagoned onto.  After I get it looking smashing good, I'll make a design switch to distingish it from the crowd effect.
