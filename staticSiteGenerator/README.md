README for Static Site Generator

This README and file in general is much more in flux and in a planning stage than the other wireframe directory.

No technical choice will be made yet, and neither will the language be chosen.

The main gist, static sites like the wireframe are very performant and optimized, but they do not scale well. Five pages to edit is fine and dandy and all, but what happens when one needs to scale to 50 pages or 100?  Mailchimp and Sass-Lang use a Static Site Generator for a reason. 

Thoughts and options: languages?  Ruby, python, javascript.

Off the top of my head, the frameworks? Middlemanapp/Jekyll, pelican, wheat/docpad/wintersmith (using ruby, python, and javascript respectively).

These decisions however will be deferred till later.
